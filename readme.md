# CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
# Project 1: Knowledge: Minesweeper

**Aim**: Write an AI to play Minesweeper.

Description: The goal in this project is to build an AI that can play Minesweeper. Knowledge-based agents like this one make decisions by considering their knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge. Propositional logic is used to structure that knowledge in our program.

There are two main files in this project:  
- minesweeper.py: contains all of the logic the game itself and for the AI to play the game.  
- runner.py: contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game using the package *pygame*.

Running the program, we can choose between playing the game ourselves (the mines will be flaged by AI using logic) or let the AI choose the next logical move.

Usage:
```
python runner.py
